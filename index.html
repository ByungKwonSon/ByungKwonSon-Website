        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Byung Kwon Son and I am a current student at the University of California Riverside. Iâ€™m 18 years old and loving life. I graduated from torrance high school. It was a great 4 years there and I loved it so much. I fell in love with the sport of golf when I was in fifth grade and kept playing constantly. I love golfing because it taught me all about respect and etiquette which I'm very thankful for. I was interested in the sport because of my dad. He showed me and taught me how to golf and I learned pretty quickly after my dad got me a swing coach. Many people told me that golf isnâ€™t a real sport but I always tell them that golf is much harder than all the other sports.<br><br>

        I was born in South Korea, Busan. I moved to the US when I was 2 years old. It felt like I barely lived in Korea because I was just an infant. When I moved to the US, my family decided to live in california. I always appreciated the California sunny weather because it truly helped me excel in the game of golf because the availability for golf was everywhere around me. I love going on hikes because it's a great workout that doesn't really feel like a work out because of the great nature all around. I always go on hikes whenever I have free time or even between classes. It helped me relieve tons of stress during school. I have tons of experience in golf because I have taken lessons for over 7 years. People always told me that golf is a 10 year sport because it's so technical and requires tons of mental strength to completely master the sport of golf. I have met tons of people through the sport of golf and it's great to see some of my friends go on to play golf for schools and organizations. Friendship means so much to me because it shows both loyalty and respect. Friends are the ones we grow and change with. Friends change the way we do things and the way we think.<br><br>

        If I ever become successful and could afford anything in the world I would buy my dream car. My dream car is a McLaren 720s and this car is my motivation to success. I always have a mentality in my head that if I grind hard then the things I want would come at ease. My main goal in life is to be completely stressless. Stress demotivates me a lot. I need to be motivated to do things and without it I feel useless to existence. I love playing league of legends because it sparked new friendships. Gaming is a big part of my life because it's a way I could relieve stress and have fun with my friends virtually. Especially because of the coronavirus, socializing is hard but through games it's a fun way to interact with them.
